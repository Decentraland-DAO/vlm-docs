### **Use Cases for Custom Rendering**:

1. **Toggle-able Virtual Stage**:
   - **Widget Use (Toggle)**: A scene admin can use a toggle in VLM to control the rendering of the video screen on the stage. When preparing for a live performance, the admin can activate the video screen and share control with the performer, allowing them to manage their visuals in real-time.

2. **Dynamic Event Spaces**:
   - **Widget Use (Selection Menu)**: Before hosting an event, the scene admin can use VLM to choose from different event layouts or configurations. They could then grant a stage manager or event coordinator temporary access to make adjustments as needed.

3. **Virtual Game Arenas**:
   - **Widget Use (Trigger Button)**: A scene admin sets up a gaming environment and uses a button in VLM to initiate game simulations or reset the arena. During eSports events, the admin might provide access to referees or game officials to control game settings.

4. **Adaptive Virtual Stores**:
   - **Widget Use (Text Field)**: The scene admin, preparing for a product launch, can dynamically set up product displays using a text field in VLM. If collaborating with brand representatives, the admin might share control to fine-tune product placement.

5. **Interactive Virtual Exhibits**:
   - **Widget Use (ISO Date/Time)**: Curating a historical exhibit, the scene admin uses VLM to select specific dates and times for content rendering. Museum guides or educators might be granted access to modify settings during guided tours.

6. **Virtual Training Simulations**:
   - **Widget Use (Numerical Slider)**: A scene admin, while setting up a training module, utilizes a slider in VLM to sequence training phases. If collaborating with a trainer, the admin shares control, allowing the trainer to adjust training environments in response to participants' needs.Ã¥
